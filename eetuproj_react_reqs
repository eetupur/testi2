npx create-react-app [name] !!creates its own folder!! -> not with .
!! --template typescript

how about git template repos??????
modifiablility harder (might become manual)
updates harder (npx create-react-app automatically uses most recent version)

create outer folder
create template

o ou
gh --template seemingly cant hanlde copying all branches
git also seems to have problemns with pull
